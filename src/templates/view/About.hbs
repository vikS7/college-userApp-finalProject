                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Smart Reflect is a modular, extensible and open source smart mirror platform made with idea of being
                    widly available to eveyone. Our platform provides simple and effective way to increase the
                    functionality of already existing smart mirror platforms.
                    We designed and developed SmartReflectâ€”a smart mirror platform that offers two main benefits, first
                    it is modular and extensible. Developers can add plugins to customize their smart mirror
                    applications and second it utilizes a server design that allows the developer to sidestep a sandbox
                    created by a web browser.
                </p>
                <p>Being an open-source development it allows an abundance of applications to be
                    developed by multiple people, expanding this project beyond what one team can easily
                    achieve. Though it offers the unlimited capability to technologically intelligent users it will
                    have a simple basic interface with the most critical functions implemented in a way that is
                    beneficial to any user. This will allow the mirror to appeal to casual users while also offering
                    advanced users any potential features they can imagine and create. </p>
                <p>With our platform we aim to create a more modular and better smart mirror with much added functionality.</p>
